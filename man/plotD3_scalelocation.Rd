\usage{
plotD3_scalelocation(object, ..., variable = NULL, smooth = FALSE,
  peaks = FALSE, point_count = NULL, single_plot = TRUE,
  scale_plot = FALSE, background = FALSE)

plotD3ScaleLocation(object, ..., variable = NULL, smooth = FALSE,
  peaks = FALSE, point_count = NULL, single_plot = TRUE,
  scale_plot = FALSE, background = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class model_audit or model_residuals.}

\item{...}{Other modelAudit or modelResiduals objects to be plotted together.}

\item{variable}{Only for modelAudit objects. Name of model variable to order residuals.
If value is NULL the data is ordered by a vector of actual response (\code{y} parameter
passed to the \code{\link{audit}} function). One can also pass any name of any other variable
in the data set. If \code{variable = ""} is set, unordered observations are presented.}

\item{smooth}{Logical, indicates whenever smoothed lines should be added. By default it's FALSE.}

\item{peaks}{Logical, indicates whenever peak observations should be highlighted. By defaul it's FALSE.}

\item{point_count}{Number of points to be plotted per model. Points will be chosen randomly. By default plot all of them.}

\item{single_plot}{Logical, indicates whenever single or facets should be plotted. By default it's TRUE.}

\item{scale_plot}{Logical, indicates whenever the plot should scale with height. By default it's FALSE.}

\item{background}{Logical, available only if single_plot = FALSE. Indicates whenever backgroud plots should be plotted. By default it's FALSE.}
}
\value{
a `r2d3` object.
}
\description{
Function \code{plotD3_scalelocation} plots square root of the absolute value of the residuals vs target,
observed or variable values in the model.
It uses output from \code{model_audit} or \code{model_residual} function.
