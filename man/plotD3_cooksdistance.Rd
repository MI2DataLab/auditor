\item{...}{Other modelAudit or modelResiduals objects to be plotted together.}

\item{nlabel}{Number of observations with the biggest Cook's distances to be labeled.}

\item{single_plot}{Logical, indicates whenever single or facets should be plotted. By default it's FALSE.}

\item{scale_plot}{Logical, indicates whenever the plot should scale with height. By default it's FALSE.}
