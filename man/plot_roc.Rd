\title{Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)}
\usage{
plot_roc(object, ..., nlabel = NULL)

plotROC(object, ..., nlabel = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{auditor_model_evaluation} created with \code{\link{model_evaluation}} function.}

\item{...}{Other \code{auditor_model_evaluation} objects to be plotted together.}

\item{nlabel}{Number of cutoff points to show on the plot. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Receiver Operating Characterstic Curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR)
against the false positive rate (FPR) for the different thresholds.
It is useful for measuring and comparing the accuracy of the classificators.

# fit a model
